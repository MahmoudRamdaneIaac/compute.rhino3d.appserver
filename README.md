# MMM, Maison Marocaine Moderne.
- The work is constantly in progress.
- The Moroccan Modern House constitues 75% of the urban landscape in Morocco. These typologies are developped in a constant speed that it is almost impossible to trace their sprawl.
- The aim of this app is to work as a plateform, and a user interface to allow users to build their own MMM, and download it as PDF kit to be used for further input to gather data about such as; the ornaments, the colors, the internal plan compositions, and the aesthetics of the people that they would input via social media.
- This app is intended to host a grasshopper definition and serve as the API that client applications can call to have definitions solved with modified input parameters.
